Trip organization web app repository

This idea came to me in 2011 when me and my friends were trying to organize a travel to Poland. We had organized a few trips before, but in those days we were all working and we had no time to meet and prepare the trip.

The main idea is to create an app that help you and your friends to organize a trip.
You can propose a destination, dates, etc. And they appear in a wall-forum thing.
Then, your friends can vote for it or propose a new and different trip.

More in detail, I would like to have a web service connection with plains, sea cruises and hotels webs like airlines, boatlines, and hotels/rooms like bnb, booking.com, etc; so the users could offer a closed price to their friends.

Of course the app could work as a social network but with limits. You can find friends, you can share your trips and after that you can share your experience with that trip.
